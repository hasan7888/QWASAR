# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

# Task

The task is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features:

sepal length

sepal width

petal length

petal width

The challenge is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can correctly predict the flower species from these numeric features.

# Description

This project uses the Iris dataset from the sklearn.datasets library.
I trained a machine learning classifier (for example, Logistic Regression or Random Forest) using scikit-learn.

Steps:

Load and explore the Iris dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a classifier (e.g. RandomForestClassifier).

Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results.

Optional visualizations are done using matplotlib and seaborn to show feature relationships and confusion matrices.

## Installation
In this challenge I used some installation like :pandas import read_csv,matplotlib import pyplot,pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix, sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, cross_val_score, sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression in jupyter.
## Usage
This was work perfectly after solving this challenge using machine learning algorithm specificaly: linear regression and its parametres like mean square error and absolute mean square error those parametres can easily handele the project requirements.
