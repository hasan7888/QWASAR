# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

# Task

The task is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features:

sepal length

sepal width

petal length

petal width

The challenge is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can correctly predict the flower species from these numeric features.

# Description

This project uses the Iris dataset from the sklearn.datasets library.
I trained a machine learning classifier (for example, Logistic Regression or Random Forest) using scikit-learn.

Steps:

Load and explore the Iris dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a classifier (e.g. RandomForestClassifier).

Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results.

Optional visualizations are done using matplotlib and seaborn to show feature relationships and confusion matrices.
